# ENME-337
A collection of MATLAB files related to the Winter 2023 ENME 337 "Computing Tools for Engineering Design" course. The repository contains the four assignments and three projects for the course. 

## Projects
### Project 1
The project calculates, given certain parameters, the wall thicknesses of the hemispherical and cylindrical walls of pressure vessel. Then, we establish if the thicknesses meet ASME requriements for a specific pressure range.
### Project 2
The project takes in input data (via the file WindProfileData.xlsx) for windspeed at an area. From this, we calculate the friction velocity and stability correction factor. We further calculate the surface roughness length. Finally, we calculate wind energy statistics and wind variation across the given time period.
### Project 3
The project analyzes cantilever and fixed trussed beams. It initilizes a beam depending on a given a beam segment length, number of nodes, and beam material stiffness. Then, it finds the equillibrium position for that beam by minimizing the system energy.

## Assignments
# Assignment 1
Basic program that analyzes matricies. Given an input, it determines if the input is a scalar or matrix. If a matrix, it determines if the matrix is square. Finally, given a square matrix, the program checks for the uniqueness of its solutions.
# Assignment 2
Given initial parameters, the program calculates the optimal split of rush vs. non-rush hours worked to maximize profits for an Uber drivers. 
# Assignment 3
The program finds a curve that, given a canvas size, splits it in two. Then, we give a second, more complex curve that has the same behaviour. 
# Assignment 4
Models and plots temperature as a function of time. Then, we calculate time to reach a certain temperature.
